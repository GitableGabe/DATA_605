## Library

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Data load
data(cars)
# libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(lmtest)
```


# Problem 1

**Transportation Safety**

**Task**

Using the cars dataset in R, perform the following steps:

## 1 

**Data Visualization**

### i

Create a scatter plot of stopping distance (dist) as a function of speed (speed).

```{r}
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Stopping Distance as a Function of Speed",
    x = "Speed (mph)",
    y = "Stopping Distance (ft)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### ii

Add a regression line to the plot to visually assess the relationship.

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkorange", size = 3) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "steelblue", se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Stopping Distance as a Function of Speed",
    x = "Speed (mph)",
    y = "Stopping Distance (ft)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```


## 2 

**Build a Linear Model**

### i

Construct a simple linear regression model where stopping distance (dist) is the dependent variable and speed (speed) is the independent variable.

```{r}
cars_model <- lm(dist~speed, data = cars)
```


### ii

Summarize the model to evaluate its coefficients, R-squared value, and p-value.

```{r}
summary(cars_model)
```

- **Intercept & Speed** of -17.5791 just indicates the stopping distance at 0 mph. The value is not important only because logically a vehicle not in motion (0mph) does not require stopping distance. The value of $3.9324$ indicates for every 1 mph $3.9324 \ ft$ is needed to stop. Therefore a minimum speed of $\approx 4.48 \ mph$ is needed before any distance is actually needed to stop.
- **R-Squared** value of $0.6511$ indicates $\approx 65\%$ of variance is captured by this relationship, so its a moderate indicator, and there may be several more and potentially stronger factor that can be used to predict the distance needed to stop.
- **P-Value** of $1.49e^{12}$ indicates that the relationship is statistically significant.

### 3

**Model Quality Evaluation**

### i

Calculate and interpret the R-squared value to assess the proportion of variance in stopping distance explained by speed.

- **R-Squared** as indicated above this means $\approx 65\%$ of the variance is captured, making this a moderate factor to stopping distance.
- **R-Squared Adjusted** Frankly, there is only 2 attributes to this table, so adjusting according to the number of predictors of the model makes little difference, therefore the variance of $0.6438$ or $\approx 64\%$  is relatively the same to the original, and the remaining factors would include attributes not collected in our dataset.

### ii

Perform a residual analysis to check the assumptions of the linear regression model, including linearity, homoscedasticity, independence, and normality of residuals.

**In order to do this without repeating the steps for Section 4 we leverage the various functions in R through the package [lmtest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lmtest/index.html)**


```{r}
cars_resid_values <- resid(cars_model)
cars_fitted_values <- fitted(cars_model)
```

```{r}
summary(cars_resid_values)
```

```{r}
lmtest::bptest(cars_model)
```

```{r}
cor(cars_fitted_values, cars$dist)
```


```{r}
dwtest(cars_model)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ks.test(cars_resid_values, "pnorm", mean=mean(cars_resid_values, sd = sd(cars_resid_values)))
```




- We have an mean of 0 which is ideal
- A correlation of  $0.8068949$ suggests strong linearity since it is close to 1.
- the $p-value>0.05$ through the *Breusch-Pagan test* ( **bptest()** ) which it is at $0.7297$ indicates homoscedasticity. 
- the $p-value$ through the *Durbin-Watson test* ( **dwtest()** ) of $0.09522$ indicated residuals are independent or has no significant autocorrelation in residuals.
- the $p-value$ through the *Kolmogorav-Smirnov test* ( **ks.test()** ) of $3.283 \times 10^-11$/ indicates its not normally distributed.


## 4

**Residual Analysis**

### i

Plot the residuals versus fitted values to check for any patterns.

```{r}
plot(cars_fitted_values, cars_resid_values, 
     xlab = "Fitted Values", 
     ylab = "Residuals", 
     main = "Cars: Residuals vs Fitted Values",
     pch = 20, 
     col = "navyblue")
abline(h = 0, col = "darkred", lty = 2)
```



### ii

Create a Q-Q plot of the residuals to assess normality.

```{r}
qqnorm(cars_resid_values, 
       main = "Q-Q Plot of Residuals", 
       pch = 20, 
       col = "darkblue")
qqline(cars_resid_values, col = "darkorange", lty = 2)
```


### iii

Perform a Shapiro-Wilk test for normality of residuals.

```{r}
cars_shapiro_test <- shapiro.test(cars_resid_values)
cars_shapiro_test
```


### iv

Plot a histogram of residuals to further check for normality.

```{r}
hist(cars_resid_values, 
     breaks = 10, # Adjust the number of bins as needed
     col = "lightgrey", 
     main = "Histogram of Residuals", 
     xlab = "Residuals",
     ylab = "Frequency",
     border = "black")
```


### Conclusion

Based on the model summary and residual analysis, determine whether the linear model is appropriate for this data. Discuss any potential violations of model assumptions and suggest improvements if necessary.

The model for this data set is reasonably appropriate, as it demonstrates moderate explanatory power $(R^2 \approx 0.65)$. While the Q-Q plot and histogram suggest residuals indicate near-normal residuals, the Shapiro-Wilk test $(p=0.02152)$ suggests mild non-normality. Additionally, the residuals vs fitted plot reveals 3 outliers that may impact the models validity. To improve the model, we can consider removing or adjusting for these outliers or testing a non-linear regression model to capture potential curvature in the data.

# Problem 2

**Health Policy Analyst**

As a health policy analyst for an international organization, you are tasked with analyzing data from the World Health Organization (WHO) to inform global health policies. The dataset provided (who.csv) contains crucial health indicators for various countries from the year 2008. The variables include:

- Country: Name of the country
- LifeExp: Average life expectancy for the country in years
- InfantSurvival: Proportion of those surviving to one year or more
- Under5Survival: Proportion of those surviving to five years or more
- TBFree: Proportion of the population without TB
- PropMD: Proportion of the population who are MDs
- PropRN: Proportion of the population who are RNs
- PersExp: Mean personal expenditures on healthcare in US dollars at average exchange rate
- GovtExp: Mean government expenditures per capita on healthcare, US dollars at average exchange rate
- TotExp: Sum of personal and government expenditures

Your analysis will directly influence recommendations for improving global life expectancy and the allocation of healthcare resources.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
who_df <- read.csv("who.csv", fileEncoding = "UTF-8")%>%
              select(-LifeExp.1,-X)
```

## Question 1 

**Initial Assessment of Healthcare Expenditures and Life Expectancy**

**Task**

Create a scatterplot of LifeExp vs. TotExp to visualize the relationship between healthcare expenditures and life expectancy across countries. Then, run a simple linear regression with LifeExp as the dependent variable and TotExp as the independent variable (without transforming the variables).

- Provide and interpret the F-statistic, R-squared value, standard error, and p-values.
- Discuss whether the assumptions of simple linear regression (linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals) are met in this analysis.


```{r}
str(who_df)
```

```{r}
summary(who_df)
```

**Create a scatterplot of LifeExp vs. TotExp**

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(who_df, aes(x = TotExp, y = LifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatterplot of Life Expectancy vs Total Expenditures",
    x = "Total Healthcare Expenditures (US Dollars)",
    y = "Life Expectancy (Years)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
who_model <- lm(LifeExp ~ TotExp, data = who_df)
```

```{r}
summary(who_model)
```

```{r}
#Residuals vs Fitted
plot(who_model, which = 1)
```

```{r}
# Q-Q plot
plot(who_model, which = 2)
```

```{r}
# Histogram of residuals
hist(residuals(who_model), breaks = 20, main = "Histogram of Residuals", xlab = "Residuals")
```

**Discussion**

### i.

Consider the implications of your findings for health policy. Are higher healthcare expenditures generally associated with longer life expectancy? 

The data shows a moderate positive relationship between healthcare expenditures and life expectancy.

- $F-statistic$ of $14.96$ and $p-value \approx 0.0004$ indicates statistical significance, suggesting the variables have a meaningful relationship with life expectancy. However, the models explains limited variability in life expectancy.
- Standard Error $(SE)$ of $10.15$ suggests a relatively good fit,providing reasonable precision of the estimating regression coefficient such as slope or intercept.
- A positive coefficient $9.641 \times 10^{-5}$ implies as healthcare expenditure increases, life expectancy improves. However, the magnitude suggests a small incremental effect.
- The residuals deviates significantly from normality, as shown by the Q-Q plot and supported by the Histogram of Residuals.
- There are no evident signs of homoscedasticity. The points do not show randomness or form a funnel or fan like shape.
- There is a clear pattern with the residuals, which do not appear random, with a visible curvature. This indicates a non-linear relationship between the variables, and makes it innappropriate to assume independence of residuals.

### ii.

What do the assumptions of the regression model suggest about the reliability of this relationship?
$R^2 = 0.2772$ suggests the relationship is no particularly strong, implying that while healthcare expenditures explain some variation in life expectancy, the model does not capture all the influencing factors.

## Question 2

**Transforming Variables for a Better Fit**

**Task**

Recognizing potential non-linear relationships, transform the variables as follows

- Raise life expectancy to the 4.6 power (LifeExp^4.6).
- Raise total expenditures to the 0.06 power (TotExp^0.06), which is nearly a logarithmic transformation.

Create a new scatterplot with the transformed variables and re-run the simple linear regression model.

- Provide and interpret the F-statistic, R-squared value, standard error, and p-values for the transformed model.
- Compare this model to the original model (from Question 1). Which model provides a better fit, and why?

```{r}
who_df$LifeExp_t <- who_df$LifeExp^4.6
who_df$TotExp_t <- who_df$TotExp^0.6
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(who_df, aes(x = TotExp_t, y = LifeExp_t)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatterplot of Life Expectancy^4.6 vs Total Expenditures^0.6",
    x = "Total Healthcare Expenditures (US Dollars)",
    y = "Life Expectancy (Years)"
  ) +
  theme_clean()
```

```{r}
who_model_t <- lm(LifeExp_t ~ TotExp_t, data = who_df)
summary(who_model_t)
```

```{r}
#Residuals vs Fitted
plot(who_model_t, which = 1)
```


```{r}
# Q-Q plot
plot(who_model_t, which = 2)
```

```{r}
# Histogram of residuals
hist(residuals(who_model_t), breaks = 20, main = "Histogram of Residuals", xlab = "Residuals")
```

- $F-statistic$ of $56.09$ and $p-value = 4.61 \times 10^{9}$ indicates the transformed model is statistical significance and captures greater proportion of variability.
- Standard Error $(SE)$ of $116,900,000$ suggests a worse fit with the precision of the estimated regression coefficient. However, this is more likely a result of the greater magnitude of the transformed variables rather than an actual decline in performance.
- Positive coefficient $295,518$ implies as healthcare expenditure increases so does life expectancy still, reflecting a stronger relationship compared to the original model.
- The residuals appear more normalized, as shown with the Histogram of Residuals and Q-Q plot. Deviations are still present, however they are less severe than the original model.
- No homoscedasticity appears with the transformation.
- Residual patterns still do not support independence between the variables.

**Discussion**

### i 

How do the transformations impact the interpretation of the relationship between healthcare spending and life expectancy? 

$R^2 = 0.5898$ suggests the relationship is strong, particularly when compare to the predecessor.

### ii

Why might the transformed model be more appropriate for policy recommendations?

The stronger relationship is highlighted after the transformation, which better accounts for the complex, non-linear relationship between healthcare expenditures and life expectancy. This approach reduces risk in model specification and captures the diminishing return on healthcare spending, that has less of an impact after a certain threshold.

## Question 3

**Forecasting Life Expectancy Based on Transformed Expenditures**

**Task**

Using the results from the transformed model in Question 2, forecast the life expectancy for countries with the following transformed total expenditures $(TotalExp^{0.06})$:

- When $TotExp^{0.06}=1.5$
- When $TotExp^{0.06}=2.5$

```{r}
who_df$TotExp_t15 <- who_df$TotExp^1.5
who_df$TotExp_t25 <- who_df$TotExp^2.5
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(who_df, aes(x = TotExp_t15, y = LifeExp_t)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatterplot of Life Expectancy^1.5 vs Total Expenditures^0.6",
    x = "Total Healthcare Expenditures (US Dollars)",
    y = "Life Expectancy (Years)"
  )
```

```{r}
who_model_t15 <- lm(LifeExp_t ~ TotExp_t15, data = who_df)
summary(who_model_t15)
```

```{r}
#Residuals vs Fitted
plot(who_model_t15, which = 1)
```

```{r}
# Q-Q plot
plot(who_model_t15, which = 2)
```

```{r}
# Histogram of residuals
hist(residuals(who_model_t15), breaks = 20, main = "Histogram of Residuals", xlab = "Residuals")
```


```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(who_df, aes(x = TotExp_t25, y = LifeExp_t)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatterplot of Life Expectancy^2.5 vs Total Expenditures^0.6",
    x = "Total Healthcare Expenditures (US Dollars)",
    y = "Life Expectancy (Years)"
  ) +
  theme_calc()
```

```{r}
who_model_t25 <- lm(LifeExp_t ~ TotExp_t25, data = who_df)
summary(who_model_t25)
```

```{r}
#Residuals vs Fitted
plot(who_model_t25, which = 1)
```

```{r}
# Q-Q plot
plot(who_model_t25, which = 2)
```

```{r}
# Histogram of residuals
hist(residuals(who_model_t25), breaks = 20, main = "Histogram of Residuals", xlab = "Residuals")
```

**Discussion:**

Discuss the implications of these forecasts for countries with different levels of healthcare spending. What do these predictions suggest about the potential impact of increasing healthcare expenditures on life expectancy?

The results reveal that transformed healthcare expenditures positively correlate with life expectancy, emphasizing the role of healthcare spending in improving population health, but its not as simple as "spend more, live forever". In countries with lower levels of spending, increased investment in healthcare could yield substantial gains in life expectancy,but returns will diminish as expenditures grow larger. The residual standard error and adjusted $R^2$ values, indicate substantial unexplained variability and suggesting life expectancy is influenced by factors beyond spending. A multifaceted approach that targets spending and addresses other determinents would yield greater benefits to the analysis.

## Question 4

**Interaction Effects in Multiple Regression**

**Task**

Build a multiple regression model to investigate the combined effect of the proportion of MDs and total healthcare expenditures on life expectancy. Specifically, use the model:

$LifeExp=b_0+b_1 \times PropMD + b_2 \times TotExp + b_3 \times (PropMD \times TotExp)$

- interpret the F-statistic, R-squared value, standard error, and p-values.
- Evaluate the interaction term (PropMD * TotExp). 

What does this interaction tell us about the relationship between the number of MDs, healthcare spending, and life expectancy?

**First I'll create an interaction model and test for significance**

```{r}
who_model_tMD_int <- lm(LifeExp ~ PropMD * TotExp, data = who_df)
summary(who_model_tMD_int)
```

```{r}
#Residuals vs Fitted
plot(who_model_tMD_int, which = 1)
```

```{r}
# Q-Q plot
plot(who_model_tMD_int, which = 2)
```

```{r}
# Histogram of residuals
hist(residuals(who_model_tMD_int), breaks = 20, main = "Histogram of Residuals", xlab = "Residuals")
```


**Considering the results I will create an additive model to interpret how they jointly affect LifeExp**


```{r}
who_model_tMD_add <- lm(LifeExp ~ PropMD + TotExp, data = who_df)
summary(who_model_tMD_add)
```


```{r}
#Residuals vs Fitted
plot(who_model_tMD_add, which = 1)
```

```{r}
# Q-Q plot
plot(who_model_tMD_add, which = 2)
```

```{r}
# Histogram of residuals
hist(residuals(who_model_tMD_add), breaks = 20, main = "Histogram of Residuals", xlab = "Residuals")
```

**Discussion**

### i

How does the presence of more MDs amplify or diminish the effect of healthcare expenditures on life expectancy? 

- Positive coefficient $4.396 \times 10^3$ from the interaction model suggests that on average, an increase of proportion of MDS leads to higher life expectancy.
- Positive coefficient $2.050 \times 10^{-4}$ implies increased healthcare expenditures is associated with higher life expectancy, assuming PropMD stays constant.
- Negative coefficient $-4.935 \times 10^{-2}$ suggests PropMD and LifeExp depends on TotExp, and vice-versa, with the positive effect of PropMD and LifeExp diminishing as TotExp increase, vice-versa.
- This generally implies diminishing return on increase of Expenditures and MDs.
- The p-value for $PropMD$ and $TotExp$ which is $0.02969$ suggests a meaningful relationship.
- For the additive model the coefficients PropMD($3.533 \times 10^{3}$) and - TotExp($5.579 \times 10^{-5}$) are still positive but smaller than the interaction model.
- The $R^2 = 0.452$ from the interaction model reducing to $R^2 = 0.3519$ in the additive, suggests less visibility with the additive.

### ii 

What policy recommendations can be drawn from this analysis?

Since the results basically describe diminishing returns on excessive increase of MDs or Expenditures, a balance between the two is ideal. For low-spending countries, increasing MDs can offset decreased life expectancy, while in high spending conutries, increasing MDs may not produce substantial improvement in life expectancy.

## Question 5

**Forecasting Life Expectancy with Interaction Terms**

**Task**

Using the multiple regression model from Question 4, forecast the life expectancy for a country where:

The proportion of MDs is 0.03 (PropMD = 0.03).
The total healthcare expenditure is 14 (TotExp = 14).

**Discussion**

### i

Does this forecast seem realistic? 

### ii

Why or why not? 

### iii

Consider both the potential strengths and limitations of using this model for forecasting in real-world policy settings.

# Problem 3

## Question 1

**Inventory Cost**

**Scenario**

A retail company is planning its inventory strategy for the upcoming year. They expect to sell 110 units of a high-demand product. The storage cost is \$3.75 per unit per year, and there is a fixed ordering cost of \$8.25 per order. The company wants to minimize its total inventory cost.

**Task**

Using calculus, determine the optimal lot size (the number of units to order each time) and the number of orders the company should place per year to minimize total inventory costs. Assume that the total cost function is given by:

$C(Q)=\frac{D}{Q} \times S + \frac{Q}{2} \times H$

Where:

- $D$ is total demand (110 units).
- $Q$ is the order quantity.
- $S$ is the fixed ordering cost per order ($8.25).
- $H$ is the holding cost per unit per year ($3.75).

## Question 2

**Revenue Maximization**

**Scenario**

A company is running an online advertising campaign. The effectiveness of the campaign, in terms of revenue generated per day, is modeled by the function: $R(t)=-3150t^{-4}-220t+6530$
Where:

- $R(t)$ represents the revenue in dollars after $t$ days of the campaign.

**Task**

Determine the time $t$ at which the revenue is maximized by finding the critical points of the revenue function and determining which point provides the maximum value. What is the maximum revenue the company can expect from this campaign?

## Question 3 

**Demand Area Under Curve**

**Scenario**

A company sells a product at a price that decreases over time according to the linear demand function:
Where: $P(x)=2x-9.3$

$P(x)$ is the price in dollars, and $x$ is the quantity sold.

**Task**

  The company is interested in calculating the total revenue generated by this product between two quantity levels, $x_1 = 2$ and $x_2 = 5$, where the price still generates sales. Compute the area under the demand curve between these two points, representing the total revenue generated over this range.

## Question 4

**Profit Optimization**

**Scenario**

A beauty supply store sells flat irons, and the profit function associated with selling 
x flat irons is given by:

$\Pi(x) = xln(9x)-\frac{x^6}{6}$ 

Where:

- $\Pi(x)$ is the profit in dollars.

**Task**

Use calculus to find the value of $x$ that maximizes profit. Calculate the maximum profit that can be achieved and determine if this optimal sales level is feasible given market conditions.

## Question 5

**Spending Behavior**

**Scenario**

A market research firm is analyzing the spending behavior of customers in a retail store. The spending behavior is modeled by the probability density function: $f(x)=\frac{1}{6x}$

Where $x$ represents spending in dollars.

**Task**

Determine whether this function is a valid probability density function over the interval $[1,e^6]$. If it is, calculate the probability that a customer spends between \$1 and \$$e^6$.

## Question 6

**Market Share Estimation**

**Scenario**

An electronics company is analyzing its market share over a certain period. The rate of market penetration is given by: $\frac{dN}{dt}=\frac{500}{t^4+10}$

Where $N(t)$ is the cumulative market share at time $t$.

**Task**

Integrate this function to find the cumulative market share $N(t)$ after $t$ days, given that the initial market share $N(1)=6530$. What will the market share be after 10 days?

# Problem 4

**Business Optimization**

As a data scientist at a consultancy firm, you are tasked with optimizing various business functions to improve efficiency and profitability. Taylor Series expansions are a powerful tool to approximate complex functions, allowing for simpler calculations and more straightforward decision-making. This week, you will work on Taylor Series expansions of popular functions commonly encountered in business scenarios.

## Question 1

**Revenue and Cost**

**Scenario**

A company's revenue from a product can be approximated by the function $R(x)=e^x$, where $x$ is the number of units sold. The cost of production is given by $C(x)=ln(1+x)$. The company wants to maximize its profit, defined as $\Pi(x)=R(x)-C(x)$.

**Task**

## Question 2

**Financial Modeling**

**Scenario**

A financial analyst is modeling the risk associated with a new investment. The risk is proportional to the square root of the invested amount, modeled as $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$, where $x$ is the amount invested. However, to simplify calculations, the analyst wants to use a Taylor Series expansion to approximate this function for small investments.

**Task**

1. **Maclaurin Series Expansion:** Derive the Taylor Series expansion of $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ around $x=0$  up to the second degree.

2. **Practical Application:** Use the derived series to approximate the risk for small investment amounts (e.g., when $x$ is small). Compare the approximated risk with the actual function values for small and moderate investments. Discuss when this approximation might be useful in financial modeling.

3. **Optimization Scenario:** Suppose the goal is to minimize risk while maintaining a certain level of investment return. Using the Taylor Series approximation, suggest an optimal investment amount $x$
 that balances risk and return.

### Submission

## Question 3 

**Inventory Management**


**Scenario**

In a manufacturing process, the demand for a product decreases as the price increases, modeled by $D(p)=1-p$, where $p$ is the price. The cost associated with producing and selling the product is modeled as $C(p)=e^p$. The company wants to maximize its profit, which is the difference between revenue and cost.

**Task**

1. **Taylor Series Expansion:** Expand the cost function $C(p)=e^p$ into a Taylor Series around $p=0$ up to the second degree. Discuss why approximating the cost function might be useful in a pricing strategy.

2. **Approximating Profit:** Using the Taylor Series expansion, approximate the profit function $\Pi(p)=pD(p)-C(p)$. Compare the results when using the original nonlinear cost function versus the approximated cost function. What differences do you observe, and when might the approximation be sufficient?

3. **Pricing Strategy:** Based on the Taylor Series approximation, suggest a pricing strategy that could maximize profit. Explain how the Taylor Series approximation helps in making this decision.

# Problem 5 

**Profit, Cost, & Pricing**

## Question 1 

**Profit Maximization**

**Scenario**

A company produces two products, A and B. The profit function for the two products is given by $\Pi(x,y)=30x-2x^2-3xy+24y-4y^2$

Where:

- $x$ is the quantity of Product A produced and sold.
- $y$ is the quantity of Product B produced and sold.
- $\Pi(x,y)$ is the profit in dollars.

**Task**

Find all local maxima, local minima, and saddle points for the profit function $\Pi(x,y)$.
Write your answer(s) in the form $(x,y,\Pi(x,y))$. Separate multiple points with a comma.

### Discussion

Discuss the implications of the results for the company’s production strategy. Which production levels maximize profit, and what risks are associated with the saddle points?

## Question 2 

**Pricing Strategy**

**Scenario**

A supermarket sells two competing brands of a product: Brand X and Brand Y. The store manager estimates that the demand for these brands depends on their prices, given by the functions:

- Demand for Brand X: $D_x(x,y)=120-15x+10y$
- Demand for Brand Y: $D_y(x,y)=80+5x-20y$

Where:

- $x$ is the price of Brand X in dollars.
- $y$ is the price of Brand Y in dollars.
- $D_x(x,y)$ and $D_x(x,y)$ are the quantities demanded for Brand X and Brand Y, respectively.

**Task**

1. **Revenue Function:** Find the revenue function R(x,y) for both brands combined.
2. **Optimal Pricing:** Determine the prices $x$ and $y$ that maximize the store’s total revenue. Are there any saddle points to consider in the pricing strategy?

### Discussion

Explain the significance of the optimal pricing strategy and how it can be applied in a competitive retail environment.

## Question 3 

**Cost Minimization**

**Scenario**

A manufacturing company operates two plants, one in New York and one in Chicago. The company needs to produce a total of 200 units of a product each week. The total weekly cost of production is given by $C(x,y)=\frac{1}{8}x^2+\frac{1}{10}y^2+12x+18y+1500$

Where:

- $x$ is the number of units produced in New York.
- $y$ is the number of units produced in Chicago.
- $C(x,y)$ is the total cost in dollars.

**Task**

1. Determine how many units should be produced in each plant to minimize the total weekly cost.
2. What is the minimized total cost, and how does the distribution of production between the two plants affect overall efficiency?

### Discussion

Discuss the benefits of this cost-minimization strategy and any practical considerations that might influence the allocation of production between the two plants.

## Question 4

**Marketing Mix**

**Scenario**

A company is launching a marketing campaign that involves spending on online ads ($x$) and television ads ($y$). The effectiveness of the campaign, measured in customer reach, is modeled by the function $E(x,y)=500x+700y-5x^2-10xy-8y^2$

Where:

- $x$ is the amount spent on online ads (in thousands of dollars).
- $y$ is the amount spent on television ads (in thousands of dollars).
- $E(x,y)$ is the estimated customer reach.

**Task**

1. Find the spending levels for online and television ads that maximize customer reach.
2. Identify any saddle points and discuss how they could affect the marketing strategy.

### Discussion

Explain how the results can be used to allocate the marketing budget effectively and what the company should consider if it encounters saddle points in the optimization.
